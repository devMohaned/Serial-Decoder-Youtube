Testing is not included in this version yet, to view the test cases, check the other repo, which I essentially made for myself:

https://github.com/devMohaned/SerialDecoderYT

SerialDecoderYT repo is the same as this one, except for 2 aspects:
- Testing (I did not record Testing on youtube yet, so there's no testing in this repo)
- Feature Decoding 
The only difference in the feature_decoding package, where on Youtube I applied the 2 design patterns, Factory, and Strategy design patterns
to improve the scalability of the app to large scale opportunities, other than that they're all the same on terms of features


Feel free to check the source code for the testing here:
